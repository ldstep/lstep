            Hey friends, let's talk social media. It's been around forever, and
            you know what? I gotta confess, I've never been a huge fan.
            Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Snapchat – I’ve had an account on any
            of them.
         </p>
         <p>
            The closest I came was Twitter. Used to have it on and off, mainly
            to keep up with current events. But after that whole thing with the
            shitposter buying XTwitter I said fuck this and deleted my account
            for good.
         </p>
         <p>
            For a while now, I've been on Mastodon. It's a different platform,
            but honestly? Here's the thing: everyone I follow there also has a
            blog with an RSS feed that follow. And guess what? The stuff I see
            on Mastodon is the same stuff I’ve already seen in those feeds.
            There's some occasional back-and-forth but for conversations I much
            prefer email. You can always reach me through my blog if you ever
            want to chat.
         </p>
         <p>
            Anyway, after a lot of thinking, I've decided to ditch Mastodon too.
            Social media, just ain't my thing. I'll still be here on the blog,
            creating and sharing my thoughts. Just minus the social media.
