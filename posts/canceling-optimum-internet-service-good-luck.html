        <h1>Canceling Optimum Internet Service? Good Luck!</h1>

		<p>The other day, I <a href="https://ldstephens.me/rant-internet-service-provider-bullshit/">wrote</a> about my experience with Optimum, our former internet service provider, and how we finally switched to Verizon FIOS. Today, Lisa called Optimum to cancel our old service.</p>

		<p>What a fucking pain in the ass! They eventually processed the cancellation, but the hoops you have to jump through just to cancel should be illegal—and soon will be.</p>

		<blockquote>
		<p>The Federal Trade Commission today announced a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/legal-library/browse/federal-register-notices/negative-option-rule-final-rule">final “click-to-cancel” rule</a> that will require sellers to make it as easy for consumers to cancel their enrollment as it was to sign up. Most of the final rule’s provisions will go into effect 180 days after it is published in the Federal Register.</p>

		<p>“Too often, businesses make people jump through endless hoops just to cancel a subscription,” said Commission Chair Lina M. Khan. “The FTC’s rule will end these tricks and traps, saving Americans time and money. Nobody should be stuck paying for a service they no longer want.”</p>

		<p>The Commission’s updated rule will apply to almost all negative option programs in any media.</p>
