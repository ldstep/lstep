            "Whenever I change blogging platforms or domain names or simply post
            to several places, I feel a twinge of guilt. How will my “audience”
            feel about the changes? Does it confuse things?[…] I don’t get a lot
            of traffic, but it’s also not zero traffic, so I feel some
            responsibility. But why? I am not writing for money or influence or
            popularity. I write to better understand what I’m thinking about,
            and sometimes share the result. I write so that I have a record of
            those things. I write, almost entirely, for me.[…] In that light, I
            shouldn’t need to worry about whether my RSS feed is consistent or
            if people need to follow me in too many places. I don’t want to be a
            dick about it, but c’mon, it’s an unimportant personal blog by some
            nobody on the internet. Let’s not overthink it."
