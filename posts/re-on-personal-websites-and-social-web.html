            on the divide between two groups regarding the future of being
            social on the web.

               And in those posts, I’m starting to see a trend of some sort.
               People are apparently starting to split into two camps that
               follow two very different ideological approaches when it comes to
               being social on the web. And when I say “people” I mean tech
               people, those who care about this type of stuff.
            </p>
            <p>
               On the other you have the people who are realising that maybe the
               solution is not to recreate social media but rather to abandon it
               and go back to a more deliberate way to be social online, using
               personal sites, small forums, emails, and other “traditional”
               tools. I’m obviously part of this second group.
            </p>
            <p>[…]</p>
            <p>
               Having said that I’m hopeful. I do think people are slowly
               starting to realise that you can get immense human value from the
               web outside of traditional social media. You have to work for it
               but it’s absolutely worth it.

            I side with Manu on this. Social Media is shit (my opinion).
            I&#8217;ve mentioned many times in the past that I&#8217;ve never
            had an account with any social media platforms that most people
            participate in, except for Twitter and Mastodon, both of which
            I&#8217;ve stopped using.
         </p>
         <p>
            Instead, I&#8217;ve discovered indie blogging and indie blogs. I
            have over 100 in my RSS feed, and I add a few new ones every week. I
            find that indie blogging provides a better, more authentic
            experience than social media by offering thoughtful content without
            the distractions of ads and algorithms. Instead of chasing likes or
            viral trends, indie bloggers write with passion, giving readers
            deeper insights and unique perspectives.
         </p>
         <p>
            Additionally, blogs create a more meaningful community where
            discussions feel genuine and less fleeting compared to social
            media&#8217;s fast-paced, superficial interactions. Bloggers also
            have full control over their content, free from the ever-changing
            algorithms that often limit visibility on social platforms.
