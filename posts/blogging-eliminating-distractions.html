            This is Lionel "Ploum" Dricot
            <a href="https://manuelmoreale.com/pb-ploum">writing</a> about his
            blog on
            <a href="https://peopleandblogs.com/">People and Blogs</a> with Manu

            <p>
               My blog is exactly where I want it to be. If I had to start
               again, I would simply do it like I did in 2022. I was quick to
               remove any form of comments from my blog and, later, any kind of
               statistics. As far as I know, I’m one of the few strong advocates
               for the complete removal of statistics/analytic/tracking tools.
               It’s not ethical to spy on users but it is also completely
               counterproductive. Statistics on websites are a brainworm. People
               are obsessed by it and it makes them write dumb stuff in order to
               increase a dumb counter. Getting rid of any audience-measuring
               tool is one of the best things I did in 2013.

            <p>
               I’ve completely deleted all my social network accounts and never
               felt so free. Ironically, the less I was using social networks,
               the more readers I had on my blog. Social networks don’t bring
               you an audience. This is a lie! Social networks distract you from
               your real work and prevent your audience from reaching you.
               That’s their whole business! I know how frightening it is to
               delete permanently an account with thousands of followers. But
               this number is also a lie.

            This quote has prompted me to rethink my approach to this blog.
            While I’ve always valued the freedom to write what I want, the
            reminder to eliminate distractions like analytics and social media
            has hit home.
         </p>
         <p>
            I've turned off analytics to focus more on the writing. I've also
            eliminated social media letting my blog stand on its own merits.
            This feels like a step toward a better connection with my work and
            readers.
