            One of my favorite things is my morning walks with my dog Trixie and
            listening to a podcast. We walk every morning rain, snow, wind, or
            freezing temperatures. We live in such a wonderful place. Our walks
            are usually about two miles. We walk out our long driveway to the
            road. The first thing we see is the farm across the street. Then, we
            turn left and walk to the neighborhood where everyone knows us, down
            to the main road, and then back up the long road to home, where
            everyone waves as they drive by. This has been a morning routine for
            going on 7 years.
