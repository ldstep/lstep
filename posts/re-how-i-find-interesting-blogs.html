            I like this conversation so I thought I would chime in: it revolves
            around how different bloggers discover new blogs.

            mentions submitting his blog to various directories but notes
            limited traffic from them.

            responds, saying they prefer discovering blogs through bloggers
            linking to or responding to each other, social platforms like
            Mastodon, and blog exploration features on platforms like
            Micro.blog. And

            at &#8220;uncountable thoughts&#8221; echoes JRN&#8217;s sentiment,
            emphasizing that blog directories aren&#8217;t heavily used for
            discovery; instead, contextual cross-linking between blogs is a more
            effective method.

            I&#8217;m relatively new to the indie blogging, so I&#8217;m always
            on the lookout for new blogs to follow. What works best for me is
            when I come across a blog that references another one I almost
            always click through, check out the &#8220;About&#8221; page, and
            skim the article archives to see if their content interests me. If
            it does, I’ll add their blog to my RSS feed.
         </p>

            For instance, if you’ve stumbled upon this blog post, you have the
            chance to discover three new blogs, in addition to mine!
