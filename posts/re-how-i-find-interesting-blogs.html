       <p>I like this conversation so I thought I would chime in: it revolves around how different bloggers discover new blogs. <a href="https://micro.bjhess.com/2024/09/13/i-appreciate-personal.html">Barry Hess</a> mentions submitting his blog to various directories but notes limited traffic from them. <a href="https://jrn.sh/post/how-i-find-interesting-blogs">JRN</a> responds, saying they prefer discovering blogs through bloggers linking to or responding to each other, social platforms like Mastodon, and blog exploration features on platforms like Micro.blog. And <a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk/re-how-i-find-interesting-blogs/">Chris</a> at &#8220;uncountable thoughts&#8221; echoes JRN&#8217;s sentiment, emphasizing that blog directories aren&#8217;t heavily used for discovery; instead, contextual cross-linking between blogs is a more effective method.</p>
       <p>I&#8217;m relatively new to the indie blogging, so I&#8217;m always on the lookout for new blogs to follow. What works best for me is when I come across a blog that references another one I almost always click through, check out the &#8220;About&#8221; page, and skim the article archives to see if their content interests me. If it does, I’ll add their blog to my RSS feed.</p>
       <p>For instance, if you’ve stumbled upon this blog post, you have the chance to discover three new blogs, in addition to mine!</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://bjhess.com">Barry</a></li>
<li><a href="https://jrn.sh">JRN</a></li>
<li><a href="https://thoughts.uncountable.uk">Chris</a></li>
