            Coincidentally I read two blog posts about RSS within days of each
            other this week. Chris is emphasizing the benefits of RSS and
            encouraging folks to start using it while Jason has decided to stop
            using it. So I thought I would chime in.

               than the web, for two reasons. Firstly, you have more chance of
               seeing my future posts that way, rather than remembering to visit
               the website again. But secondly, and more importantly, I think
               you will have an improved digital life if you incorporate RSS
               into your daily habits.

               I decided to try something old-school, relatively “low-tech” and
               “slow-tech.” I deleted my RSS Reader app (NetNewsWire) from all
               my devices. And I have no web bookmarks to Feedly. But how would
               I keep up with the latest? What about the cool sites I follow?
               Answer: <i>surf the web!</i>
            </p>
            <p>
               Now I simply rely on my browser’s <b>bookmarks</b>. I made a
               folder called, “RSS Replacement” and saved all the sites that I
               like to visit for new articles. So I more <i>intentionally</i> go
               to my bookmark folder and click those I want to visit when I
               think to do so. I no longer feel pulled to frequently check an
               app — pull to refresh.

            I appreciate Jason's reasoning for deciding to stop using RSS but I
            side with Chris on this. I have been using RSS for as long as I can
            remember. Here's why: using RSS centralizes my favorite blogs and
            news sites, all in one place. I get real-time updates and I never
            miss a post from my favorite bloggers. Without RSS there is little
            chance that I would have ever seen the blog post above written by
            Chris and Jason.
