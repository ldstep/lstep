         <p>
            In 2024, I picked up the lstep.xyz domain with the idea of using it
            as a space to blog about non-tech stuff. All my tech related writing
            happens over at <a href="https://ldstephens.me">ldstephens.me</a>.
            But honestly? The way I’ve used it so far has been all over the
            place. I hosted it on Pika off and on, but I was never fully settled
            on it.
         </p>

         <p>
            Lately, I’ve been thinking about moving it to a static site. I
            finally did it. The biggest reason was that I didn’t want to be tied
            to a platform. That’s exactly why I moved ldstephens.me to a static
            site too. Sure, I love the technical challenge, but more than that,
            I wanted full control. Platforms change, they shut down, and they
            enforce rules. When you own your own site, you make the rules.
         </p>

         <p>
            This blog is mine. I built it myself, and I’m proud of that. Now I
            can do whatever the hell I want with it. It’s my own little corner
            of the internet. When you run your own site, you control everything.
            The content, the design, the URLs everything. No middlemen, no
            restrictions. Just a direct line between me and whoever stops by to
            read.

            Oh, and if you’ve been following via RSS, don’t worry. I’ve set up a
            301 redirect, so your feed should keep working just fine.
