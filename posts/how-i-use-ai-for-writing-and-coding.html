         <p>
            I’ve been using AI in two ways: for help with my writing and for
            figuring out how to do things.
         </p>

         <p>
            My writing skills aren’t that great. I know what I want to say and
            how I want to say it, but I struggle to put it into words. So, I use
            AI to proofread and improve the structure of what I’ve written.
         </p>

         <p>
            The other way AI helps me is with writing HTML and CSS for my static
            blog projects. I use it to explain things in HTML or CSS and to
            offer the code. For example, yesterday, I had a couple of posts
            where I kept getting an error in my HTML, and I couldn’t figure out
            what was wrong. So, I copied the code and put it into Claude. It
            rewrote the code and explained what it fixed. I guess you could call
            that debugging my code.
         </p>

         <p>
            AI has become a valuable tool for me. Whether it’s helping me
            improve my writing or troubleshooting code, it saves me time and
            makes things easier.
