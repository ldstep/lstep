		<p>I’m going to use whatever apps I feel like using on any given day. That’s just the way I am. The trick is to stop thinking that I need to choose something <i>for good</i>. I can just pick up whichever tool gives me the best vibes right now and stop worrying about which is “best”.</p>

		<p>I'm like this when it comes to writing apps. I feel like I need to pick an app and stick with it. But the truth is, some days I like to write in Drafts other days I like to write in MarkEdit as I’m doing now. And then on another day, I’ll use iA Writer.</p>
		<p>I also do this with my RSS aggregator apps. I bounce around between Reeder, NetNewsWire, and Unread.</p>
		<p>Then there’s the Mac or iPad conundrum.</p>
