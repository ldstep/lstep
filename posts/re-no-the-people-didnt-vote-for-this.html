            <p>
               Democrats, obviously, aren’t thrilled, but the more meaningful
               data is that
               <a

                  >Republicans don’t like what Elon Musk is doing</a
               >
               at all.[…] Voters who supported Trump based on economic promises
               are instead seeing federal support for their local hospitals
               vanish, government contracts that supported thousands of local
               jobs disappear, and consumer prices continue to rise. The very
               voters who wanted economic stability are getting the opposite:
               economic chaos driven by an unelected billionaire’s personal
               agenda.
