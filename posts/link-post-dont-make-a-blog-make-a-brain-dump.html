               Another problem arises when you finally do convince someone to
               start “blogging” online; self-doubt.
            </p>

            <ul>
               <li>“What could I possibly have to share?”</li>
               <li>“What if everyone hates what I post?”</li>
               <li>“What if my content sucks?”</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
               Just dump it. Who cares. It’s the internet after all, so who are
               you trying to impress? The point is that your sharing your own
               experiences that are unique to you as an individual. Posting
               something that you think is pointless or mundane might be
               extremely helpful or, at the very least, entertaining for someone
               else.
            </p>

            <p>
               Write up what you did over the weekend, a new recipe you tried
               out, review a movie/book or video game you enjoyed, list
               step-by-step instructions on how you installed a new appliance in
               your house - anything! Just write and be part of what made the
               internet fun, exciting and personal again.
            </p>
