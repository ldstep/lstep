               I wrote to myself yesterday saying that I'm resigned to the fact
               that I'm not going to make "serious" money online. On one hand,
               it sucks to think that I have all these big plans for myself and
               realize that no, I'm not going to make a living out of this. On
               the other hand, it's freeing: I can write anything I want without
               worrying about the quality, or feel like I need to be a "content
               creator".

            Lately, I've noticed a growing trend among fellow indie bloggers
            attempting to monetize their blog. It's become apparent that
            something fundamental has changed. The content I once enjoyed
            reading regularly has changed, and unfortunately, not for the
            better. These bloggers seem to be adjusting their writing style and
            content strategy, likely in pursuit of attracting more subscribers.
            And the frequency of their posts has increased, but the substance
            has dwindled.
         </p>
         <p>
            The question that lingers is whether the income generated from these
            efforts significantly impacts their lives financially. I bet that in
            99.9% of cases it doesn't. By switching to a monetized model for
            your blog you will probably piss off a lot of your faithful readers.
            So why bother?
